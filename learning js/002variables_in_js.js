Does we need Memory for running a program ?
yes. why -> 1. bcoz jab wo program run hoga tabhi to execute hoga!
            2. or run krane ke liye humne usse processor(CPU) ko wo program dena hoga.
            3. or cpu can't talk direclty to secondary mmry thats whY RAM.  

DOES WE NEED ONLY SPACE IN RAM EQUALS TO THE PROGRAM SIZE ? 
NO , BCOZ in a program also we have variables, arrays defined, recursion calling using stack and etc..
     so in chizon ke liye bhi space chaiye or ye space program execute hone pe decide hogi, jaise 
     jaise space ki need hogi waise waise RAM me space milti jayegi.

so all the variables, arrays, recurions GETS MEMORY FROM THE RAM.


VARIABLES -> variables is a block of memory allocated in the ram that stores VALUE and also has it name . name refers to the location.

        NOW IN JS WE CAN DECLARE VARIABLES IN 3 WAYS!
        1. USING var keyword -> var a=10;   -> now this line is giving instruction that plz create 
                                               a block of memory , named as a having value = 10.
        2. USING let keyword -> let a=10;
        3. USING const keyword -> const  a=10;
