// -0 helps in finding direction of the player in the game
// NaN -> stands for not a number
//      -> it is used where u r bound to return a no. , but there is no valid possible no. to return.
//      -> ex-> console.log(10/null) -> returns NaN.


// WHICH IS THE ONLY NO. IN JS WHICH IS NOT EQUALS TO ITSELF?
// NaN -> it's a fact no prove.
